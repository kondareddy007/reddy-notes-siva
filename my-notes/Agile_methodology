DevOps with Agile
-----------------------
DAY-1

developer writes some code, the same day build(compile and pack) the code, test it

100 lines of code --> testing is simple
no of invalid defects are less
2 valid defects --> very easy to developer
Ops --> testing, build and release(DevOps)

We create a process called CICD with the help of tools, the same day we are able to build and test the application

DEV QA UAT PRE-PROD PERF PROD

1. Faster releases
2. Less defects

speed and accuracy

DevOps == Continous improvement
	DevSecOps --> added security inside it
	shift left
	GitOps --> Entire process should be in Git.
