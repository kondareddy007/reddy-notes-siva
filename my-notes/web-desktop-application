Web based appliactions --> 3 tier architecture

He has to take care of cooking, billing, serving, ordering, cleaning, etc.
10 persons

1         sivakumar  sivakumar   M         siva123    `9-AUG-2024   01-01-01

Chef == App server

username, password

through SQL queries, app server will check the data
CRUD

select * from user where user_name='sivakumar' and password='siva123'

WebServer --> put that into HTML format, so that a normal can easily format

{
	"user":"sivakumar",
	"dob":"01-01-01",
	"location":"bangalore"
}
