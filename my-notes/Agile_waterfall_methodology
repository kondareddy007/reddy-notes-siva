Waterfall Model
------------------
fathers generation == Waterfall model

2 years time to complete

stakeholders = customers, developers, testers, managers, end users, etc.

developers --> are they serious from DAY-1
testers --> no they are not serious
clients --> they are worried from DAY-1

after 1 year they got seriousness

developers develop it in 6 months
deploy the application --> build and release in DEV

testers starting testing --> 100 defects
some are invalid --> 20 invalid defects

after 2 years, they release something --> maruti 800


Agile
-------------------------
Sprints --> Installment based based deliveries

modules -->
User management --> 1 months
	signup
	login
	forgot password
	change password

product management
	list the products
	prices
cart
	add to cart
shipping
	adding address
payment
order management

User management --> 1 months
15 days --> development
15 days --> testing and deployment

testing --> 30 defects
10 invalid defects

client test the user management --> 10 bugs

product management == clear the previous bugs and develop product management

ferrari == fortuner

DevOps with Agile
-----------------------
DAY-1

developer writes some code, the same day build(compile and pack) the code, test it

100 lines of code --> testing is simple
no of invalid defects are less
2 valid defects --> very easy to developer
Ops --> testing, build and release(DevOps)

We create a process called CICD with the help of tools, the same day we are able to build and test the application

DEV QA UAT PRE-PROD PERF PROD

1. Faster releases
2. Less defects

speed and accuracy

DevOps == Continous improvement
	DevSecOps --> added security inside it
	shift left
	GitOps --> Entire process should be in Git.
